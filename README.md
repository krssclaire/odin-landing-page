# odin-landing-page

This project is part of The Odin Project Foundations Course, and it is the final project after the Flexbox section.

Even if the assignment suggests to be creative adding our own content, I decided to make a clone of the webpage in the screenshot provided for instructions (desired-outcome.png in outcome-design folder). 

The design of this webpage is desktop first and it should be responsive on both computer and mobile.
