# odin-landing-page

This project, suggested by The Odin Project Foundations Course, is the final project after the Flexbox section.

I decided to make a clone of the webpage in the screenshot provided for instructions. Note that it isn't actually perfectly the same as this exercise what intended to practice "making UI interfaces via visual".
